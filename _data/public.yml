    date:  March 2017
    topic: public_talks_dark_matter
    description: "Dark matter is an enigma. Even though it can be “seen” through its influence on gravity, dark matter is invisible to the other known forces of nature. There are numerous ongoing efforts to discover the origin and properties of dark matter, ranging from laboratory experiments to astrophysical investigations. This intense interest is driven in part by tantalizing hints that the nature of dark matter might be linked to other deep and unsolved mysteries in physics. In this talk, Prof. Thaler presents the overwhelming evidence for dark matter as well as speculates on the broader implications of the invisible universe."
