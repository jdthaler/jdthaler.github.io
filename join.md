## Prospective Postdocs

With its huge breadth of research interests and expertise, the [Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP)](http://ctp.mit.edu/) at MIT is a great place to do postdoctoral research.  For researchers working at the intersection of physics and AI, there are also opportunities to engage with the [Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)]([http://iaifi.org/).  Specific postdoctoral opportunities to collaborate with me and my group include:

  * [CTP Postdocs](http://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/MIT/CTP/){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill.button--sm} (typical deadline mid-November)
  
  * [IAIFI Fellowship](https://iaifi.org/fellows.html){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill.button--sm}  (typical deadline mid-October)
  
  * [Pappalardo Fellowship](https://physics.mit.edu/research/pappalardo-fellowships-in-physics/){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill.button--sm} (requires nomination in early September)


## Prospective Grad Students

I anticipate at least one opening in my research group in the coming years.  I am particularly interested in supervising students in the [MIT Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Statistics (IDPS)](https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/idps-physics/), though I am open to working on all aspects of physics in and beyond the standard model. 

  * For **current** MIT graduate students, please [send me an email](mailto:jthaler@mit.edu) with your CV and previous research experience.
  * For **prospective** MIT graduate students, please apply to the [MIT Physics PhD Program](https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-students/graduate-admissions/).  If you are admitted, I would be delighted to talk to you about research opportunities in my group at the [Physics Graduate Open House](https://physics.mit.edu/openhouse/) event typically held in early April.


## Prospective Undergraduates

To do meaningful research in theoretical particle physics at the undergraduate level, you must have taken at least a course on Relativity (8.033) and a full year of Quantum Mechanics (8.05/8.06).  I often work with students who have been exposed to some graduate-level courses at MIT, though there are also research projects available for students with extensive programming experience.

### Current MIT Students

  * If you are interested in working with me, please [send an email](mailto:jthaler@mit.edu) with your CV and previous research experience.
  
  * Funding is available through: [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](http://web.mit.edu/UROP/){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill.button--sm}
  
  * I sometimes work with MIT Master's students through:  [EECS MEng Program](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/meng-program/){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill.button--sm}

### Other Universities

  * Visiting students must have full financial support to come to MIT.  Self-funded visits are not possible.
  
  * I primarily work with summer interns through: [MIT Summer Research Program](https://oge.mit.edu/graddiversity/msrp/){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill.button--sm}

  * I do not typically have openings for non-MIT Master's students in my group. 


## Prospective High Schoolers

  * Currently, I am not conducting research with high school students.
  
  * High school students can gain research experience through: [Recommended Summer Programs](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/summer/){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill.button--sm}
