### Prospective Postdocs

With its huge breadth of research interests and expertise, the [[http://ctp.mit.edu/|Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP)]] at MIT is a great place to do postdoctoral research.  There are also opportunities to engage with the [[http://iaifi.org/|Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)]].  Specific postdoctoral opportunities to collaborate with me and my group include:

  * [[http://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/MIT/CTP/|Postdoctoral positions in the CTP]] (typical deadline mid-November)
  * [[https://iaifi.org/fellows.html|IAIFI Fellowship]] for researchers working at the intersection of physics and AI (typical deadline late September)
  * [[https://physics.mit.edu/research/pappalardo-fellowships-in-physics/|Pappalardo Fellowship]] for exceptional postdoctoral candidates (requires nomination in early September)


### Prospective Graduate Students =====

I anticipate at least one opening in my research group in the coming years.  I am particularly interested in supervising students in the [[https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/idps-physics/|Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Statistics (IDPS)]], though I am open to working on all aspects of physics in and beyond the standard model. 

  * For **current** MIT graduate students, please [[jthaler@mit.edu|send me an email]] with your CV and previous research experience.
  * For **prospective** MIT graduate students, please apply to the [[https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-students/graduate-admissions/|MIT Physics PhD Program]].  If you are admitted, I would be delighted to talk to you about research opportunities in my group at the [[https://physics.mit.edu/openhouse/|Physics Graduate Open House]] event typically held in early April.


### Prospective Undergraduate Students =====

To do meaningful research in theoretical particle physics at the undergraduate level, you must have taken at least a course on Relativity (8.033) and a full year of Quantum Mechanics (8.05/8.06).  I often work with students who have been exposed to some graduate-level courses at MIT, though there are also research projects available for students with extensive programming experience.

  * For current **MIT undergraduate students**, please [[jthaler@mit.edu|send me an email]] with your CV and previous research experience.  Funding is available through the MIT [[http://web.mit.edu/UROP/|UROP]] program.
  * For students at **other universities**, there are potential opportunities to work with me through the [[https://oge.mit.edu/graddiversity/msrp/|MIT Summer Research Program]].


===== Prospective High School Students =====

Currently, I am not conducting research with high school students.  However, MIT offers a number of [[http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/before/summer_programs/|Summer Programs]] for high school students to gain research experience.
